# DynDns53 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/volkanx/dyndns53.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/volkanx/dyndns53)

DynDns53 is a dynamic DNS tool using AWS Route 53. Your domains need to be hosted on AWS Route53. It has several clients:

* Angular 5
* .NET Core console application
* Docker Image running .NET Core application
* WPF Client
* .NET Framework Console application / Windows Service

## Angular 5

The website for the client is here. You can simply enter your keys and domains here and start using it right away.

The keys are stored locally on the browser so nobody will have access to them.
